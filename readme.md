## About
~~~
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I have finished my Ph.D. in applied mathematics, mainly focusing on the theoretical aspects and algorithm design of Mathematical Optimization. I have later shifted my focus, during my postdocs, on the applications of mathematical modeling and optimization in Medical Physics, and particularly radiotherapy cancer treatment planning. I am currently a faculty member at MSKCC where I am collaborating very closely with clinicians to use mathematical optimization in real clinical environments.  
<br /> We have recently developed and clinically deployed an in-house automated treatment planning system called ECHO (Expedited Constrained Hierarchical Optimization) which is being used routinely in the clinic with more than 6,000 patients treated to date (Sep, 2022). ECHO was nominated as a finalist for the prestigious Franz Edelman 2021 award (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;895M6j5KjPs&amp;t&#61;1025s">YouTube</a> | <a href="/assets/Edelman-ECHO-Slides.pdf">Slides</a> | <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/do/10.1287/orms.2021.02.24p">Podcast</a> | <a href="https://www.informs.org/About-INFORMS/News-Room/Press-Releases/Finalists-Selected-for-the-World-s-Leading-Operations-Research-and-Analytics-Award-2021-INFORMS-Franz-Edelman-Competition-Elevates-Research-that-is-Saving-Lives-Saving-Money-and-Solving-Problems">Edelman Competition</a>).
<br /> We are also working on developing an open-source codebase package called <a href="https://github.com/PortPy-Consortium">PortPy</a> (Planning and Optimization for Radiation Therapy) to accelerate the development and clinical translation of radiotherapy treatment planning algorithms by promoting transparency, reproducibility, benchmarking, and community-driven development.
